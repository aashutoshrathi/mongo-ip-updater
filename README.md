# Mongo NAL Upsert

This is a simple extension to add or update your IP addresses into a [MongoDB Access List](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/).

> **Note**
> This is for very very lazy and my kinda people, who don't want to do anything manually.

## Motivation ðŸ¤”

Unstable internet connection is already a pain, when you have to access some remote database from local setup, and your IP changes very often, it becomes a pain in the arse to update the MongoDB's allowed list of IP addresses.

This extension will help you to update your IP address in the access list with just one click.

## Demo ðŸ“º
