# Mongo NAL Upsert

This is a simple extension to upsert your IP addresses into a [MongoDB NAL](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/).

## Motivation ðŸ¤”

Unstable internet connection is already a pain and when you have to access some database from local, but your IP changes very often, it becomes a pain in the ass to update the NAL to allow your IP.

This extension will help you to update your IP address in the NAL with one click.
